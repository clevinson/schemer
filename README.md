# Schemer

So I wanted to work on my Haskell and
[this](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours)
seemed to be like a nice way to do it.

##Dependencies

Requires a working installation of [Stack](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)

##Build

`stack build`

##Run

`stack exec schemer "(some (lisp (expression)))"`
